== Description ==

This is the long description.  No limit, and you can use Markdown (as well as in the following sections).

For backwards compatibility, if this section is missing, the full length of the short description will be used, and
Markdown parsed.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.



== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What's the purpose of this plugin? I don't get it. =

This plugin was built to scratch an itch related to constantly swapping plugins from a large list on a development site to
facilitate testing support tasks/bugs. Certain tasks required certain plugins to be activated for testing. You can easily switch between them with this plugin.
Maybe this is helpful to you, maybe not.

= Why not just have different plugins installed on different development site? =

That's what I normally do, but sometimes it's easier when you have good test data on one site available to just install all the plugins you need
and switch between them.

== Screenshots ==

the /assets directory or the directory that contains the stable readme.txt (tags or trunk). Screenshots in the /assets
directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png`
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).
