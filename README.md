## Frequently Asked Questions ##

### What's the purpose of this plugin? I don't get it. ###

This plugin was built to scratch an itch related to constantly swapping plugins from a large list on a development site to
facilitate testing support tasks/bugs. Certain tasks required certain plugins to be activated for testing. You can easily switch between them with this plugin.
Maybe this is helpful to you, maybe not.

### Why not just have different plugins installed on different development sites? ###

That's what I normally do, but sometimes it's easier when you have good test data on one site available to just install all the plugins you need
and switch between them.
